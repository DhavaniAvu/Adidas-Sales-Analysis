The specific data elements incorporated into an Adidas sales dataset may diverge based on the source and the intended purpose for which the data is employed.

## Project Overview
The Adidas sales analysis project aims to explore, analyze, and understand the sales patterns of Adidas products using a dataset that includes various features such as product categories, sales figures, and time-related data. The primary focus of this project is to identify key trends and insights that can drive data-driven decisions for optimizing sales strategies.

## Research Questions
What are the overall sales trends of Adidas products over time?
Which product categories and regions contribute most to sales?
How do sales figures vary across different time periods (e.g., seasons, months)?
What factors influence sales performance, and how can we predict future sales?

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data Import and Inspection: Loaded the dataset and inspected the initial structure for completeness and consistency.
Handling Missing Values: Identified missing values and handled them using imputation techniques where necessary.
Data Transformation: Converted data types to appropriate formats, such as converting dates into datetime objects for time series analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Computed mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other statistical measures to understand data distribution.

## Data Visualization:
Sales Trends Over Time: Plotted line charts to visualize sales trends over different periods.
Category Analysis: Used bar charts to compare sales across different product categories.
Regional Sales: Mapped sales figures across regions to identify top-performing areas.
Seasonal Patterns: Analyzed sales data across seasons to detect seasonal trends and patterns.
Techniques and Analyses
